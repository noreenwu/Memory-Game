# Overview

This memory game is the electronic analog to what many of us played as kids using cards.
Typically played as a single user game, the objective is to find the  matching pair
for each overturned card. But one can only turn over two cards at a time.

In this version of the game, you have unlimited time to find all pairs. Any two
mismatched cards that are overturned is considered a wrong move. If a player
finds all matches with less than 4 wrong moves, the game is considered 3-star;
if in less than 7 moves, it's a 2-star game and if in less than 10 moves, it's
a 1-star game. Any games that complete with 10 or more wrong moves receive no
gold stars (just gray stars). The amount of time a player takes to find all the
matches is also recorded and displayed throughout the game and at the game's end.
